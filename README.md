# SeleniumFrameworkDesign
## Introduction

This Selenium Automation Framework is designed to test web applications using Selenium WebDriver, Java, and TestNG. It implements the Page Object Model (POM) to maintain a clean and manageable codebase.

## Deliverables

- **Page Object Model Implementation**: Classes for managing page elements and interactions.
- **Test Cases**: Predefined test cases to validate 6 test cases.
- **Base Page Class**: Provides common functionality for all page classes.
- **TestNG Configuration**: XML file to configure and run the test suite.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java**: Ensure Java is installed and properly configured on your system. (JDK 8 or above is recommended)
- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management. Ensure Maven is installed.
- **WebDriver**: Download the appropriate WebDriver executable for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome) and ensure it is accessible in your system's PATH.
